# Advent of Code 2021 in Clojure

My solutions for [Advent of Code](https://www.adventofcode.com) 2021 using Clojure.

## Notes
### Day 1

### Day 5
#### Part 1
Consider only straight (horizontal or vertical) lines.

* remove diagonal lines
* Create all points as 2D vectors `[x y]`
* filter out all points with frequency < 2 and count them

The points get created by iterating over the range x1-x2 and y1-y2 (input for
range needs the first element smaller, so we sort).

At first I used `reduce` to concat the vectors with points for a line, but of
course I can just use `mapcat` for that.

#### Part 2
Consider also diagonal lines. All diagonals have an angle of 45 degrees.

Keep the general plan, but change how the points get created. We can't iterate
over the range x1-x2 and y1-y2, because we get a rectangle for the diagonal
inputs.

The iteration to create the points will be something like: Figure out the
direction of the x and y component of a line (+1 or -1). Start with the
starting x and y value and generate the next value for x and y by applying the
direction. Stop when you reached the end point.

I couldn't figure out how to do this in a more non-declarative way, but got an
idea from reddit: Just build an iterating function, that applies the direction.
Then `iterate` it and `take-while` the end point hasn't been reached.
